## WHAT IS FRANCEFORWARD?

> Understand, discuss and act on issues around you

France Forward is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to enable citizens to educate themselves on social issues, discuss and initiate or join actions around them to improve the situation.

In France, 90% of citizens want to act for the good of society, but only 10% do so. It’s hard to get involved on your own terms, while at the same time non-profits struggle to find volunteers

It takes the form of a platform referencing and describing social issues, with a collaborative discussions/actions management tool where people can join actions around them.
