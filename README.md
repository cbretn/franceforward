#### WHAT IS FRANCEFORWARD?

* Name
France Forward

* Tagline
Understand, discuss and act on issues around you

 1 - What's the pain? Which problem do we want to fix?
90% of citizens want to act for the good of society, but only 10% do so. It’s hard to get involved on your own terms, while non-profits struggle to find volunteers

2 - The first user segment (the more niche the better)
Socially-conscious tech-savvy French citizens
Non-profits

3 - The attempted solution
A platform referencing/describing social issues, with a collaborative discussions/actions management tool where people can join actions around them

4 - How will the solution be original & innovative?
Original: bottom-up approach to social impact, easy for ppl to get involved
Innovative: inventing the tools & behaviours for widespread collaboration
